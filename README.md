# Maching Learning Research Group at TektonLabs

## Requirements

* basic knowledge in python3
* basic knowledge in linear algebra

## Tools

* jupyter: the prefer way to install it is using [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)
* [sci-kit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/): one of the simplest machine learning library
* [Keras](http://keras.io): high-level neural network api running on top of Tensorflow, CNTK or Theano
* Machine Learning APIs by Google:  a bunch of general machine learning models written as APIs,we can find an example of their usage in the [Google IO 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1xNTLH1zlA)
    * [Video Intelligence](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/)
    * [Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
    * [Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech/)
    * [Natural Language](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)
    * [Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/)
